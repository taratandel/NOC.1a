A comparative analysis of capacity of CCDM-based probabilistic shaping applied on 64-QAM in an attempt to achieve better channel capacity at low SNR (1 to 20 dB). Shannon capacity is compared to equiprobable unshaped 64-QAM, Maxwell-Boltzmann ideally shaped 64-QAM, and a more coarse-grained CCDM-based shaping that quantizes Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by using MATLABÂ®. A gain of up to 0.6 dB has been theoretically found.
